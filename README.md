# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## What is the Daily Scheduler

The Daily Scheduler is an application that allows the user to input daily tasks and stay update to date on what needs to be completed down the road during the day. With the ability to save tasks into a local storage, once a task is created and saved, users will be able to focus on the tasks at hand without having to worry and constantly remember what tasks are ahead.

## WHy it was coded

This application was coded to allow the user to freely work on those hourly tasks wihtout having to constantly repeat in their head of what is to do in the following hour. With the constant refresh of the timer, users who use the application will not feel left behind in what needs to be accomplished.


## How does the Daily Calendar work?

The application is straight forward in terms of the user functionality. Once the user clicks on the application, they will be presented the hourly time, a blank text space and a save button. For example, if one has a task at 9:00am to complete a coding assignment. The user will use the text space to type "Finish coding assignment," and click SAVE. What that does is, the local storage will save that text space at that hour of 9:00am. From there the application will branch off in terms of its functionality. For starters, as the time goes from 8:59am to 9:00am, the text space that was editied with the tast will turn from green to red to let the user know that, that is the current hour. Once the time goes from 9:59am to 10:00am, the hour slot that has the task will turn grey to show that the hour is over. Another branch of the functionality is the ability to edit the text space used to display the tasks. For that to work, one must click on the desired task to edit, make the changes and hit save again. That way the local storage will save the edited change in the specific hour.
